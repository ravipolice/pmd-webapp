# ✅ Image Upload Deployment Checklist

## Current Status
You're getting: **"The script completed but did not return anything"**

This means `doPost()` is executing but not returning a value.

## 🔍 Diagnostic Steps

### 1. Check Apps Script Execution Logs

1. Go to https://script.google.com
2. Open your project
3. Click **Executions** (clock icon on left)
4. Find the latest execution (should be recent)
5. Click on it to see logs
6. Look for these messages:
   - ✅ "doPost called with action: uploadImage" → doPost is being called
   - ✅ "=== Routing to uploadImage ===" → Routing works
   - ❌ "ERROR: uploadProfileImage function not found" → Missing file
   - ❌ "ERROR: uploadProfileImage returned null" → Function exists but not returning

### 2. Verify Files Exist

In Apps Script editor, check the file list:
- [ ] `EMPLOYEE_SYNC_FINAL.gs` (or `Code.gs`)
- [ ] `IMAGE_UPLOAD.gs`

**If `IMAGE_UPLOAD.gs` is missing:**
1. Click **+** (Add file)
2. Name it `IMAGE_UPLOAD.gs`
3. Copy contents from `IMAGE_UPLOAD.gs` file
4. Save

### 3. Verify Function Exists

1. In Apps Script editor, click the function dropdown (top right, says "Select function")
2. Type "uploadProfileImage"
3. If it appears → Function exists ✅
4. If it doesn't appear → Function missing ❌

### 4. Test Function Directly

1. Select `uploadProfileImage` from dropdown
2. Click **Run**
3. It will show an error (expected - needs parameters)
4. But it confirms the function exists

### 5. Check Deployment

1. Click **Deploy** → **Manage deployments**
2. Check your latest deployment:
   - **Type**: Should be "Web app"
   - **Execute as**: Should be "Me"
   - **Who has access**: Should be "Anyone"
3. If wrong, create a **new deployment**

## 🚨 Most Common Issues

### Issue 1: Missing File
**Symptom**: Logs show "uploadProfileImage function not found"

**Fix**: Add `IMAGE_UPLOAD.gs` to the project

### Issue 2: Old Deployment
**Symptom**: Changes not reflected

**Fix**: Create a **new deployment** (don't just update)

### Issue 3: Wrong Deployment Type
**Symptom**: HTML error page

**Fix**: Must be "Web app", not "API executable"

### Issue 4: Function Not Returning
**Symptom**: Logs show function called but no return

**Fix**: Check `IMAGE_UPLOAD.gs` - all code paths must return `jsonResponse()`

## 📋 Quick Test

Add this temporary function to test:

```javascript
function doPost(e) {
  Logger.log("TEST: doPost called");
  return ContentService.createTextOutput(JSON.stringify({test: "working"}))
    .setMimeType(ContentService.MimeType.JSON);
}
```

1. Deploy this
2. Test the URL
3. If you get `{"test":"working"}` → Deployment works ✅
4. If you get HTML → Deployment is wrong ❌

Then restore the real `doPost()` function.

## 🎯 Next Steps

Based on execution logs:

1. **If "function not found"** → Add `IMAGE_UPLOAD.gs`
2. **If "returned null"** → Check `IMAGE_UPLOAD.gs` code
3. **If no logs at all** → Deployment issue or wrong URL
4. **If logs show errors** → Fix the specific error

## 📞 What to Share

If still not working, share:
1. Screenshot of Apps Script file list
2. Screenshot of execution logs
3. Deployment settings (type, access)
4. Any error messages from logs
