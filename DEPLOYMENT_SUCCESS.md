# ✅ Deployment Success!

## 🎉 New Deployment URL Updated

Your new deployment is working! The Android app has been updated to use the new URL.

### New Deployment URL:
```
https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbyEqYeeUGeToFPwhdTD2xs7uEWOzlwIjYm1f41KJCWiQYL2Swipgg_y10xRekyV1s2fjQ/exec
```

### ✅ What Was Updated:

1. **`ImageRepository.kt`** - Updated `baseUrl` (line 55)
2. **`GDriveUploadService.kt`** - Updated comments with new URL
3. **`ImageUploadRepository.kt`** - Updated `UPLOAD_URL` constant

## 🧪 Test the Upload

1. **Rebuild the app** in Android Studio
2. **Run the app**
3. **Try uploading an image** (from My Profile screen)
4. **Check Apps Script Executions** to see logs

## 📊 Expected Behavior

### ✅ Success Signs:
- Image uploads successfully
- You see logs in Apps Script Executions:
  - `"=== doPost START ==="`
  - `"doPost called with action: uploadImage"`
  - `"=== START uploadProfileImage ==="`
  - `"✅ File created in Drive"`
- Image URL is saved to profile

### ❌ If Still Failing:

1. **Check Apps Script Executions** (most important!)
   - Go to: https://script.google.com
   - Click **Executions** (clock icon)
   - Find the latest execution
   - Share what logs you see

2. **Verify Deployment Settings:**
   - **Execute as**: `Me`
   - **Who has access**: `Anyone`
   - **Type**: `Web app`

3. **Test URL in Browser:**
   - Open: `https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbyEqYeeUGeToFPwhdTD2xs7uEWOzlwIjYm1f41KJCWiQYL2Swipgg_y10xRekyV1s2fjQ/exec`
   - Should see: `{"error":"Invalid action: undefined"}` ✅
   - If you see HTML → Deployment issue

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Rebuild and test** the app
2. **Try uploading an image**
3. **Check execution logs** if there are any issues
4. **Share the results** if it's still not working

The deployment is confirmed working (returns JSON), so the upload should work now! 🚀
